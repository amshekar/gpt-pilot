Secure User Authentication: Task the models with generating code for a secure user authentication system. It should include features like password hashing, salting, session management, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Financial Transactions: Request the models to write code for a robust financial transaction system. It should handle sensitive user data, implement encryption algorithms, and incorporate security measures like input validation, access control, and protection against common threats like man-in-the-middle attacks.

Concurrent Processing: Challenge the models to generate code for a concurrent processing system that efficiently manages multiple tasks or requests simultaneously. It should address issues like thread synchronization, deadlock prevention, and resource allocation to ensure reliable and optimal execution.

Error Handling and Logging: Evaluate the models' ability to generate code that implements effective error handling and logging mechanisms. This includes proper exception handling, informative error messages, error recovery strategies, and comprehensive logging practices for debugging and auditing purposes.

Code Testing and Quality Assurance: Task the models with writing code that automates testing processes, such as unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests. The generated code should demonstrate best practices for test coverage, test case design, and quality assurance to ensure reliable and maintainable software.

Cryptographic Algorithms: Challenge the models to generate code for implementing complex cryptographic algorithms like RSA, AES, or SHA. This will help evaluate their ability to handle intricate mathematical calculations, manage key generation and management, and implement secure encryption and decryption processes.

Database Security: Request the models to write code that addresses database security concerns. This may involve implementing secure SQL queries, protecting against SQL injection attacks, encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit, and applying access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized data access.
